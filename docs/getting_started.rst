Getting Started
===============


This page details how to get started with MonteCarlo.

Installation
------------

To install MonteCarlo, you will need an environment with the following packages:

* Python 3.11
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

Once you have these packages installed, you can install MonteCarlo in the same environment using :
::
    git clone git@github.com:dyk6704/MonteCarlo.git
    cd MonteCarlo
    pip install -e .

Usage
-----

Once installed, you can use this package to compute spin energy, average energy, magnetization, magnetic susceptability, and heat capacity for a 6 site lattice, and plot the outputs.

.. code-block:: python

    import MonteCarlo
